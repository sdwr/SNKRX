turn game into rts :o

-------------
BUGS:
--------------
combat:
shouldn't be able to push bosses with units
should be able to hit enemies without needing to hit the exact center (mainly problem with bosses)
necromancers (+healers?) all target same corpse/unit

items:
no item tooltip when hovering in inv
items too big coming from shop
saving/enter arena with item on cursor?


no safety checking on unit spawn (fixed? can have units on top of boss when spawns, no crash)
web build (take out sound?)


-------------
GAMEPLAY TUNING:
--------------
enemy summoners are too good, either kill them right away or lose to the summons
rounds are too fast? 

think about build variety:
  tanky melee
  squishy ranged
  aoe vs single target
  summoner

------------------
ADDITIONS:
------------------

tooling:
  debug mode
    go to level from buy screen
    free gold

items:
  cost 1/3/5 or 2/5/10
  can have some # on each squad
  new UI for items, move squads to center of buy screen?
  think about taking out character rolling, move to popup card on certain levels

  how will items combo? need to have value, can't be too degenerate (stack dmg on sniper)


  damage:
    flat dmg 
    %dmg
    %aspd
  
  survival:
    vamp
    shield
    armor/hp?

  utility:
    move speed
    ghost through units
    basher
    slow/freeze
    aura

  special:
    revive after death for 5s
    thorns
    heal over time
    stim pack

 ̶ ̶a̶d̶d̶ ̶s̶u̶m̶m̶o̶n̶e̶r̶

  add laser enemy
  add star projectile enemy (shoots projectiles in 6 directions at same time)
  add annoying flyers (circle around the arena, tiny projectiles that do not too much damage, small hitbox?, don't collide with objects)
  add horde-type summoner (lots of little fast summons)

  add leapers
  add homing missiler
  add ranged archer

  add bosses
  ogre boss, big aoe stomp
  snake boss, burrows into ground / charges?


  - change spawn logic
    * fixed by level?
    * all at once or over time?

    * units shouldn't move towards target when attack is on cooldown
      - how?
    * units should only chase when attack is off cooldown, not preemptively
    * troops move too quickly, makes kiting feel weird
      * try adding turn time?
  - triggers
    * enemies should be able to attack on spawn, instead of waiting full cd
      - add "cooldown_immediate" type trigger? works like cooldown trigger and also starts immediately?
  - effects

        * fizzle? go on cd?

CODE CLEANUP:
  - create global list of friendly classes
  - unify target selection, attack triggering
    * need proper lambdas? delayed functions cant have params
  
    



debugger
  - find/setup debugger for when game hangs

ui
  - show nice cursor
  - add unit hotbar per class
    * ui bar
    * list of owned units
  - show unit attack CD somehow
  - a̶d̶d̶ ̶c̶a̶s̶t̶i̶n̶g̶ ̶a̶n̶i̶m̶a̶t̶i̶o̶n̶

controls
  - control by class is not fun
    * units aggro too quickly, can't pull multiple classes off enemies simultaneously
    * try rally to location instead of rally while mouse pressed

units
  - collision? clustering?
  - add safe unit create that checks for clipping/ finds new spawn
  - turn time
    * already in engine
    * see if attacking requires LoS angle

combat
  - attack timing quantized to beat?
    * classes can have different timings
    * troops within class can be on different sub-beats (1/2/3/4)
    * makes music out of sound effects


unit stats
  https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1HRqfD-rEdXdnwLKPiguDDNjRDQcnUGDvvm0q2Mh2z8E/edit#gid=0
  - add group size
  - change range, aggro range

Invoker - casts attacks and spells from other units
  having a unit like this from the start will help ensure that attacks are behind function calls that can be accessed by another unit easily rather than mostly hidden like they are now

Future ideas:
Chaos related classes
Cartographer - https://i.imgur.com/Bz6glry.png
Trappers:
Emitters: +projectile damage, projectile mods
  warping
  homing/barrage
  wavy, 90, 45 degree
  splitting tears
  Traps - map modifier
    turrets attached to walls shoot single, slow moving projectiles in a predictable pattern that deal lots of damage
  Triangler - drops a trap and the 3rd trap will trigger the area, dealing X AoE damage 2-3 times
Brawlers: units focused on crashing on enemies
  https://i.imgur.com/5YubukS.png - unit idea
Bodyguard - https://i.imgur.com/Y2pP20v.png
Conjurer unit that creates an unit that actively protects you from enemy projectiles
Guardians - https://i.imgur.com/Ynu5Cdw.png
Cultists - https://i.imgur.com/GsfoZBd.png
psyker + builder - https://i.imgur.com/VjY6r1d.png
Assists (2/4) - 
  Ringmaster (tier 4 assist, nuker) - +15% to all stats to adjacent units, Lv.3 effect - create a cross that deals AoE damage 5 times for 10 seconds
  Absorber (tier 2 assist, warrior) - absorbs 50% damage from adjacent units, Lv.3 effect - absorbs 75% damage from adjacent units and gives the absorber +25% defense
  Pardoner (tier 3 assist, mercenary) - 
  Oracle (tier 1 assist) - +10% dodge chance to adjacent units, Lv.3 effect - +20% dodge chance to adjacent units
  Seraph (tier 2 assist, healer) - periodically chooses 1 random unit and gives it +100% defense for 6 seconds, Lv.3 - choose 2 units instead
Add a few builder units that create walls/solids the player can hide behind (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KqwBZ_2f7QU&t=2331s)
Hexblaster? - curser that consumes curses to deal damage
Bench? - https://i.imgur.com/B1gNVKk.png

Roguelite update:
  Technical improvements:
    Spawn tech: spawn every entity in a grid, before spawning check to see if grid position is clear, this will prevent any issues due to entities spawning inside one another
    Battle stats: DPS, damage taken, etc (check Underlords)
    Tag system: similar to PoE
    Keyword explanations: similar to StS or Artifact, simply create additional text windows for keywords and what they mean
    Key rebinding (for non-QWERTY keyboards)
  StS-like map with nodes, node types:
    Arena
    Elite
    Boss
    Map (map of bigger size than arena with fixed spawns)
    Unit shop
    Item shop
      Once there are enough items there can be item tiers
      The item shop should work similarly to the normal shop, where it can be upgraded and then have a higher chance for higher tier items
    Text + reward
    Training grounds (upgrade unit)
    Tavern (heal units)
    Challenge + reward
      Go through the labyrinth without hitting any walls
      Go through the traps without getting hit
    Room ideas - https://i.imgur.com/ajqtTOc.png
  Units die permanently when they die (dead units can be stored in bench to be revived later)
  Units can have items attached to them like in Underlords
  Unit item ideas:
    This unit's projectiles pierce/chain/fork/seek/split/stun/etc
    This unit is a [class]
  New stat system:
    Most stats are values from 1 to 10 (can be lower than 1 or higher than 10 due to debuffs/buffs) that represent consistent internal values between all units
    i.e. 3 attack speed means the same internal attack rate value (like say 6 seconds) for the entire game
    In general it's better if units don't have hidden internal multipliers on these stats, although sometimes that may be inevitable
    Damage:
      Hit:
        Everything hits except DoT
      Damage type:
        Attack - physical attacks, decreased by the enemy's armor
        Spell - magical attacks, decreased by the enemy's magic resistance
      Attack type:
        Crash - damage dealt when bumping into enemies
        Projectile - damage dealt by projectiles
        AoE - damage dealt in an area
        DoT - damage dealt over time
    Attack speed:
    Defense:
      Armor - decreases damage taken from attacks
      Magic Resistance - decreases damage taken from spells
    Movement speed:
