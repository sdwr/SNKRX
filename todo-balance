GAMEPLAY TUNING:
-------------
balance the starting gold curve
level 1
  - buy 1 unit
level 2
  - buy an item (or two?)
  - or save for a unit
level 3
  - buy a unit (if you saved)
  - or buy an item
  - or save for a unit
level 4
  ???

possible troop x item costs:
--------------------------
Troop | 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 |
------------------------
  10    3   6   9   12

  5     2   4   8   12

whats the difference?
the more expensive items, the more powerful they can be
just king has 9 cost items and 3 cost units
but also stacks units to lvl 3 = 5x unit cost
maybe higher tier troops cost more?


difficulty has to ramp faster
level 1
  -easy with any troop
level 2
  -first special enemy
  -need some stats or good movement
level 3+
  - boring right now

maybe set a "expected curve" for swordsman buying +dmg items every round
  - then tune the enemies to that curve

take out leveling the shop, just have a hidden level
  - that increases with round

take out leveling troops
  - too confusing, overlaps with items too much
  - too much to balance

start with 1 unit per troop, buy additional up to cap?
  - either always available for gold
  - or as a shop item

consider combining troops and items into one shop
  - like HS battlegrounds, you can buy a unit or an item

GAMEPLAY THOUGHTS:
--------------
enemy summoners are too good, either kill them right away or lose to the summons
rounds are too fast, multiple waves? 

think about build variety:
  tanky melee
  squishy ranged
  aoe vs single target
  summoner

also, what enemies require different builds?
  non-piercing projectiles need tanks in front or shields
  backline summoners/casters need sneaky assassin or sniper with targeting
  spam/lots of enemies need AoE

balance to facilitate:
  give melee more hp/def
  aoe should do less single-target dps


make table of enemy hp vs unit damage 
don't go blind into balancing
make sure later waves have enough threats to be able to cast a few spells (can't kill every enemy at start)

different enemy sizes

how to make fun? 
what does SNKRX do:

  instant control - only two buttons
  constant threat - lose a few units and the rest of the round is harder/impossible
  difficulty scaling - starts easy, NG+
  scaling within a game - first few levels are easy, difficulty spikes that require buying out

  enemy variety
    green infectors
    white turrets
    blue bombers
  
  have to react differently to enemy types

  eye candy - lots of player effects
    AoEs
    critter spawns
    chain attacks
    homing missile

  lots of player attacks happening in rhythms, enemy attacks are "burstier" (watch for a while, react suddenly to bomb/charge etc)

  UNDERLOD is too chaotic, with 3/4 mortars you have to dodge too much


  buy screen:
    always something to look for (matching sets)
    units start off simple, scale into "god units" (tier 4)
    units combos (aura +attack speed, match damage types, global buffs)
  
to replicate in RTS game:

  start out with slower units, slower paced fights
  introduce special enemies gradually, have tiers of special units
  multiple waves in round, increase tension/healing/setup

  right click target? focus down with snipers
