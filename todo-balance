GAMEPLAY TUNING:
-------------
balance the starting gold curve
level 1
  - buy 1 unit
level 2
  - buy an item (or two?)
  - or save for a unit
level 3
  - buy a unit (if you saved)
  - or buy an item
  - or save for a unit
level 4
  ???

possible troop x item costs:
--------------------------
Troop | 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 |
------------------------
  10    3   6   9   12

  5     2   4   8   12

whats the difference?
the more expensive items, the more powerful they can be
just king has 9 cost items and 3 cost units
but also stacks units to lvl 3 = 5x unit cost
maybe higher tier troops cost more?


difficulty has to ramp faster
level 1
  -easy with any troop
level 2
  -first special enemy
  -need some stats or good movement
level 3+
  - boring right now

maybe set a "expected curve" for swordsman buying +dmg items every round
  - then tune the enemies to that curve

take out leveling the shop, just have a hidden level
  - that increases with round

take out leveling troops
  - too confusing, overlaps with items too much
  - too much to balance

start with 1 unit per troop, buy additional up to cap?
  - either always available for gold
  - or as a shop item

consider combining troops and items into one shop
  - like HS battlegrounds, you can buy a unit or an item

BALATRO PROGRESSION:

round power:
1 1.5 2
300
800
2000
5000
11000
20000
35000
50000


rewards:
$5 base + $0-3 bonus

shop screen:
2 jokers ($2-$6 ea?) [or face card]
$10 voucher
2 packs ($4-$8 ea) [joker or arcana or ??]
reroll $5

-------------------
so round 1
can buy 2 jokers or joker and pack
not voucher
and not really reroll

------------------
total choices per round:
 - skip blind, delayed reward
 - new joker (MAIN POWER)
 - planet cards (incremental power)
 - arcana pack (gamble, choose incremental power)
 - voucher (permanent upgrade)

and the curve is:
  - early game, buy lots of jokers, big power boost
  - mid game, lock in a strategy
  - round out the jokers, start w/ arcana and planets

---------------
the key to the jokers is that they combine in emergent ways
more interesting than +dmg, +hp
the dimensions are:
 - +stat vs +mult
 - buff hand vs buff card
 - econ cards
 - build score over time
 - plus some randos that break the game

underlod item dimensions could be:
 - +hp vs +attack? meh
 - +atk vs +aspd? kinda works if there are real reasons to pick 1
  - ex attack triggers 1 time bonus that does/doesn't stack
    - heal to nearby allies
    - poison target
    - mark target for death, explode on death
- elemental damage?

should stay away from flat buffs like +20% aoe
boring and polarizing - either good or bad

items in tiers
but even low tier items are crazy good
high tier is just insane

if t1 items are too good, strat is load up on t1s right away
kinda good gameplay

what should the base power be for a t1 item?
we want to be able to buy 1 or 2 items on round 2
then 1 or 2 per round until we level up/get new char

to feel meaningful, they should be 30-50% multiplicative boost

too much overlap b/t items and characters?
could reduce characters to basic warrior/archer/mage
and put the whole build in the items
would mean having items act as weapons as well
probably better to still have characters

should items stack with each other?
  -slow from ice orb chains on maelstrom proc
yes: more item interaction
no: turns into stack everything mash

how does tiny rogues do trait combination?
traits stack like crazy, but only within their domain
there are pet traits
and stat traits
and proc traits
and they mostly interact only within their realm
but a few cross over to keep you thinking

how to apply that to items?

------------
ITEM IDEAS:
------------
- 20% dmg, slow on hit
  - good with aspd, good on ranged

- flat lightning damage on hit, chains
  - good with aspd, good early

- mark for death, enemy explodes if killed in 5seconds (and/or takes +dmg)
  - good mixin, good with aoe

- heart of gold, +hp +gold
  - econ choice, reference

- radiance, burn aura (+shield every few seconds?)
  - aoe, good on melee

- bloodlust, mspd and aspd at start of round
  - good with burst

- 20% aspd, 10% range
  - good lategame, good on ranged, can still use on melee

- flat heal to nearby ally/aoe on hit
  - good early

- % vamp heal to self on hit
  - sustain, scales

- 15% mspd, phasing(??)


- potions that are 1-round only?

-------------
GAMEPLAY THOUGHTS:
--------------
enemy summoners are too good, either kill them right away or lose to the summons
rounds are too fast, multiple waves? 

think about build variety:
  tanky melee
  squishy ranged
  aoe vs single target
  summoner

also, what enemies require different builds?
  non-piercing projectiles need tanks in front or shields
  backline summoners/casters need sneaky assassin or sniper with targeting
  spam/lots of enemies need AoE

balance to facilitate:
  give melee more hp/def
  aoe should do less single-target dps


make table of enemy hp vs unit damage 
don't go blind into balancing
make sure later waves have enough threats to be able to cast a few spells (can't kill every enemy at start)

different enemy sizes

how to make fun? 
what does SNKRX do:

  instant control - only two buttons
  constant threat - lose a few units and the rest of the round is harder/impossible
  difficulty scaling - starts easy, NG+
  scaling within a game - first few levels are easy, difficulty spikes that require buying out

  enemy variety
    green infectors
    white turrets
    blue bombers
  
  have to react differently to enemy types

  eye candy - lots of player effects
    AoEs
    critter spawns
    chain attacks
    homing missile

  lots of player attacks happening in rhythms, enemy attacks are "burstier" (watch for a while, react suddenly to bomb/charge etc)

  UNDERLOD is too chaotic, with 3/4 mortars you have to dodge too much


  buy screen:
    always something to look for (matching sets)
    units start off simple, scale into "god units" (tier 4)
    units combos (aura +attack speed, match damage types, global buffs)
  
to replicate in RTS game:

  start out with slower units, slower paced fights
  introduce special enemies gradually, have tiers of special units
  multiple waves in round, increase tension/healing/setup

  right click target? focus down with snipers
