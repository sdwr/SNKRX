TODO:
  
  -boss hp bar segments for phases

  - do ranged enemies need a melee attack? (can sit on them right now)
    - damage on contact
    - knockback stomp 
  
  - add more dodgeable attacks / enemies
    - laser is good
    - spread laser 
      - shoots in star pattern all at once
      - or rotating around unit
    - homing missile (slow, dodgeable)

  - make miniboss versions of regular enemies
    - make them bigger
    - give them stronger stats
    - make their special ability better

  -add environmental effects to levels
    -hazards:
      -laser (fixed position, moves back and forth, rotates slowly
         rotates towards player, then charges up and fires)
      -laser grid (spaced, at intervals, sweep across screen or out from center)
        -vertical or horizontal
      -fire wall (moves back and forth)

  - make units not chase towards enemies when they are in range (+ push the enemy away)
  
  - add new enemy movement patterns
    - avoid player (for summoners)
    - move randomly (for bullet hell)

  - make screen transition circle always white

  -add title card + hp bar animation to start of boss battles
    -black transition wipe?

  -add "on round start" to proc

SMALL CLEANUP:
  --stunned laser enemy still fires laser, and has no cooldown ("cast" never triggers, but laser happens in precast)
  --heal doesn't get cleaned up when exiting arena (on quit from settings?)
    --units persisting after round end ??
    -- how is garbage collection working on units/teams/procs?
    -- i thought game objects were naturally culled
    -- procs aren't game objects
    -- and are definitely sticking around (at least with active timers)

  -- swordsman doesn't target enemy critters

  --Helper.DamageCircle is hurting troops (overkill)

  --troops aggro towards enemies, but not quite close enough to attack
  
  --laser secondary hit detection is stingy (maybe not registering points?)

  --some item text not disappearing properly on death
  --all items are destroyed exiting buy screen, will trigger consumable effects
  --grabbed item draws behind item boxes, should be in front (moving to tutorial group doesn't fix)

--------------
NEW FEATURE PLAN:

get the playthrough to be fun:
  - v2 items
    - add item synergies

    - pass owner unit to :hit() from helper.spell (already done when possible?)

  - add level modifiers (maybe don't need, overlaps with special enemies)
    - berserk
    - infected
    - shielded
    - capture point

  - add passive traits (pick 1 of 3?)
    - lightning damage mult
    - after dealing lightning damage, gain mspd (aspd?) for 3 seconds

    - burn damage lasts longer
    - after dealing burn damage, gain armor for 3 seconds

    - cold slow stacks with itself
    - when a unit affected by cold dies, freeze nearby enemies for 1 second

    - crit chance
    - 

-------------
BUGS:
--------------

crash:
  crash when spawning units inside each other (fixed for boss though?)
  check global GameState references - had a bug trying to set the rallyEffect in the main menu

combat:
  safety dance doesn't damage every time
  ghost units stack ontop of each other
  critters arent affected by slow
  basher doesn't work (black circle)
  buffs with same name don't stack properly (first amt gets duration refreshed)
  buffs aren't the right size on all units (hidden under square, too big around rect)

units:
  shouldn't be able to push bosses with units

shop screen:
  item overlay doesn't work in windowed mode
    - they are an overlay on the game window
    - but are scaled to fullscreen
    - too big and in the wrong place in windowed mode

  items display on top of the settings menu
  items too big coming from shop
  saving/enter arena with item on cursor?
  
  guide/restart buttons hover overlaps troop display

---------------
CODE CLEANUP:
---------------
  
ui
  - show nice cursor
  - show unit attack CD somehow

shop ui
  - show item cost in corner
  - show troop/item stats without needing to hover

units
  - collision? clustering?
  - add safe unit create that checks for clipping/ finds new spawn
  - turn time
    * already in engine
    * see if attacking requires LoS angle

combat
  - attack timing quantized to beat?
    * classes can have different timings
    * troops within class can be on different sub-beats (1/2/3/4)
    * makes music out of sound effects

---------------
OPTIMIZATION
---------------
stats are recalculated every frame
  switch to "push" system from "pull
  buffs with durations, apply once, then unapply at expiration

lots of n^2 calculations in new spell system
finding targets

------------------
FEATURES:

tooling:
  one-click builds
  mac/web build?!?!
  debug mode
    fps counter tracks longest frames

items:
  legendary items (T3, T4)
  most of the randomness will be coming from items now, need flashy and strong items for the endgame

  think about unlocking items/classes per run, replayability

    %̶d̶m̶g̶
    %̶a̶s̶p̶d̶

  capture point
    capture for team heal
    capture for team aspd
    capture to freeze/damage enemies
      unkillable enemies that need to be wiped with capture point?


allies
  needler 
    shoots clip of bullets in random spray around target
  
  bomb dropper

  engineer
    spawns turret
    


enemies
  add annoying flyers (circle around the arena, tiny projectiles that do not too much damage, small hitbox?, don't collide with objects)
  add horde-type summoner (lots of little fast summons)

  add leapers
  add homing missiler
  add ranged archer

  add minibosses
    scaled up versions of regular casters


  add bosses
  ogre boss, big aoe stomp
  snake boss, burrows into ground / charges?
  heigan, safety dance


  - change spawn logic
    * fixed by level?
    * all at once or over time?

allies

  - healers
  healers should also fight
    paladin: heal and tank
    * d̶i̶s̶c̶ ̶p̶r̶i̶e̶s̶t̶ ̶(̶s̶h̶i̶e̶l̶d̶)̶

    * stealthed unti attacks
    * leaps backline
    * disengage on low hp?

  nuker (orange)
  - cannon
  - flamethrower


  - leaping zergling

tuning
  - movement
    caster enemies shouldn't chase (bullet-hell/spread, summoners)
      maybe move randomly or try to escape

  - triggers
    * enemies should be able to attack on spawn, instead of waiting full cd
      maybe? easily doable with new spell system

  - spells
      * what to do with overheal/multi-bubble/necromancer if multiple caster pick same target
        * fizzle? go on cd?
